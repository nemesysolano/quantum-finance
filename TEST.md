## Strategies ##

### Breakout Trading Strategy ###

It will only execute when the price has reached the breakout point. The breakout price must be at least 10% away from the breakout price (support or resistance).

### Reversal Trading Strategy ###

Reversal trading strategy using support and resistance lines (S & R lines) is exactly the counterpart of breakout trading strategy. Again, a 10% threshold is required to dispatch signal.
